# Python Automation for Intercompany Transactions

## Intro and Preparation

This post demonstrates how we can use Python and Pandas library to help us do intercompany transaction journal entries automatically. The scenario and the requirement in this post is easy to understand. In real life, it can be more complex and need extra lines of codes to be solved.

To use this code to automate your accounting process, you should have:
- Python3 installed
- Pandas library

To make it easier to test and use your code, you can have
- Jupyter notebook
- Sublime Text
- Pyinstaller (to give this code to your colleagues who have no programing experience)

## Accounting Requirement (scenario)

*You can quickly scan through or skip this part if you are well knowledged in intercompany transaction.*

### Bill

We have expenses incurred in one subsidiary.

For example, Lisa, a marketing specialist of your company, is going to host a large marketing campaign in US for the development of US business. She spent some money on this campaign so you can record it in the expense system like this. 

|Sub|Account| Debit  | Credit | Explanation |
|----|-----| ------------- | ------------- |--------|
|DE|Campaign Expense| $10,000.00  |   | Bill |
|DE|Account Payable to Credit Card|   | $10,000.00  | Bill |

Memo: Lisa's campaign cost in U.S. (Lisa is a DE employee)

We assume the above has been fully automated and the below has yet to be automated.

### Intercompany Transaction Journal
However, because Lisa is not an employee from your US subsidiary but an employee from your German subsidiary, these expenses are actually paid by DE. For some reasons, she spent this money out of her pocket *or* from her German Corporate Credit Card. So this bill is recorded back to her own company - the German subsidiary.

Based on the above bill, the global accounting team needs to record an intercompany transaction journal, which includes four lines of entries, to transfer this expense from DE to US:

|Sub|Automation| Debit  | Credit | Explanation |
|----|-----| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|DE|Account Receivable from U.S.| $10,000.00  |   | Intercompany Transaction |
|DE|Campaign Expense|   | $10,000.00  | Intercompany Transaction |
|US|Account Payable to DE|   | $10,000.00  | Intercompany Transaction |
|US|Campaign Expense| $10,000.00  |   | Intercompany Transaction |

Memo: Lisa's campaign cost in U.S.

### Requirement
- Create a core function to generate the last four lines of entries based on the first two lines.
- Given a list of bills
-- classify them into different groups according to:
--- subsidiary
--- reference number
--- subsidiary
