Hi I'm Zishi. I'm from Beijing, China.

Currently, I'm working as an accountant in a fast growing American SaaS company (1.5-year working experience). Not like traditional accountants, I write python and VBA codes and develop programs and tools to automate our accounting working process. I also develop BI reports and online/offline dashboard for accounting ERP systems. It makes me more like a data analyst.

I have a bachelor degree in Inter-culture Communication of English and a master degree of Professional Accounting. None of them are related to math, programing and data analysis but it does not stops me from learning them. After I graduated, I learned Python, SQL and VBA and am able to use them in work. I also got a certificate of [Data Analytics Foundations for Accountancy II](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/RK83Y97QPK8G) in coursera which means I am ready to use machine learning techniques to do some real world projects.

This blog is used to share useful learning notes and real accounting analysis/automation projects.

If you believe that one can turn one's passion into reality, you are not alone.
