This is a practice for data science analysis. This is not yet finished but already has all the sections a project should have. I will be updating the jupyter notebook constantly.

**The targats for this practice:**

- Take this excercise as a preparation for kaggle competitions
- Hands-on experience to data analysis, cleaning and modeling
- Review visual analytic skills (matplotlib and seaborn)
- Use interactive ploting module: plotly (taking a Udemy course now)

**Sections:**

- Define the problem and understand the data
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Single Variable Analysis
  - Multiple Variable Analysis
  - Correlation Analysis
- Model Selection
- Validation
- Model Improvement
